\subsection{Introduction}\label{intro}
 SDL\_\-Console is a console that can be added to any SDL application. It is similar to Quake and other games consoles. A console is meant to be a very simple way of interacting with a program and executing commands. You can also have  more than one console at a time.

\subsection{Documentation}\label{docs}
 For a detailed description of all functions see {\bf CON\_\-console.h} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{CON__console_8h})}. Remark that functions that have the mark \char`\"{}Internal\char`\"{}  are only used internally. There's not much use of calling these functions.

Have Fun!
